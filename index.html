<p> Difference between NOSQL and relational databases : When to use what ?

1: SQL - have to follow a predefined schema, whereas nosql allows insertion of data without predefined schema

2: Sharding : Relational databases scale vertically which is expensive as a single sever has to be made more powerful. It is better to scale horizontally by adding more servers instead of concentrating more capacity on a single server.
